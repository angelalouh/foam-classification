# Foam Classification App
Culture Biosciences: Take Home Challenge

Created a foaming classification system based on the following four requirements:
- As a user, I need to be able to view images from the reactor run.
- As a user, while viewing images I need the ability to mark them as foaming or not.
- As a user, I want my decisions to be stored for the next time I use the app.
- As a user, I need to be able to filter by foaming, non-foaming, and unclassified images.
